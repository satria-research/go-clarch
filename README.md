# GO CLARCH

> Go Clean Architecture Boilerplate
> New to Clean Architecture? [Learn Here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

A familiar architecture is MVC, but MVC is not enough to be a highly agile business solution today [Learn Here](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/when-crud-mvc-isnt-enough/).

On the other hand, the fame of the existing framework becomes a kind of boundary for those who are not used to using a particular framework.

Changes to packages from third parties are also a challenge, such as changing the database from PostgreSql to Mongo.

## 🍰 The Layer

| Layer                | Directory          |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Frameworks & Drivers | /app/infra         |
| Interface            | /app/interfaces    |
| Usecases             | /app/usecases      |
| Entities             | /app/domain/entity |

## 🧐 The Questions

- ### Why placing all layer to one folder (app)? \

  Bcs using this infrastructure (clean architecture), we must highlight the 4 layer in folder and ensure the concept is clean (no other file or folder).

- ### Why using json validator than others for request validator ? \

  Request validator have several option u can see [here](https://daltontan.com/comparison-of-golang-input-validator-libraries/29/).
  We use [go-playground/validator](github.com/go-playground/validator/v10) because is very simple and clean, bcs just put in json tag, that(json tag) is familiar in go.

- ### Why separate file interface, implementation in Usecase and Frameworks & Drivers layer ? \

  The concept come from [Bridge Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge/go/example), in Usecase imagine u have 2 user (student and teacher) with same action but different behavior (bcs business rules), in Frameworks & Drivers imagine u must transition change the db from Postgres to Mongo.

## ⚡ Fiber Go

We use fiber for routing and more, you can change whatever you like (echo, gin, chi, etc).
Why fiber? learn [here](https://gofiber.io/)

## 🌊 Air

If you familiar with nodemon in nodejs, air is exactly same. Provide hot reloading when files change with auto build.

Visit: https://github.com/cosmtrek/air for installation guide

## 🧪 Debugger

If you come from PHP maybe you use var_dump(), if u from javasript maybe u use console.log(), in GO u can use fmt.Println() or u can use logging with log.Println().

But if u don't know before, using debugger is awesome and helpful (If u use VS Code), u just go to debug and run the debugger. The config in .vscode in the project. Wanna try? Learn [here](https://medium.com/@slamflipstrom/debugging-with-visual-studio-code-857904a8a590)
